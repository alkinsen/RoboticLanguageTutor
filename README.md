# Robotic Language Tutor

Robotic Language Tutor is our graduation project build on IrisTk to be used on a [Furhat](https://www.furhatrobotics.com/).

Learning English as a second language is very hard and costly. On the other hand, babies and young children can acquire a language if it is introduced at an early age. Our aim is to allow children to be raised bilingually with the help of non-English speaking caretaker. The research indicates that human interaction is essential in acquiring a language so we cannot simply expect the robot to be sole interactor. We use a robotic language tutor to make the interaction between the baby and the non-English speaking caretaker in English. 


Click the furhat photo for a quick demo where I act as the non-english speaking caretaker, and my group partner Romi is the child.
- You can listen to the instructions only the caretaker(in Turkish) hears from right speaker or read the yellow text.
- You can hear what the baby hears by listening only from left speaker or read the white text.
