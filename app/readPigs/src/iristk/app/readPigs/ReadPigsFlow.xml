			<dialog:say>The Three Little Pigs.
Once upon a time, there lived three little pigs.
Each little pig built a house. The first little pig built a straw house.
A wolf knocked on the door.
Let me come in, said the wolf.
No!, said the little pig.
Then I will blow your house in!, said the wolf.
The wolf blew the house in.
The little pig ran to his brothers house.
The second little pig built a house of sticks.
He was not afraid of the wolf.
Let me come in, said the wolf.
No!, yelled the pigs.
The wolf blew the house in.
The little pigs ran to their brothers house.
The third little pig built a brick house.
His brothers warned him about the wolf.
Let me come in, yelled the wolf.
No!, shouted the little pigs.
The wolf huffed and puffed.
But the wolf could not blow down the brick house.
The three little pigs lived happily ever after.</dialog:say>
